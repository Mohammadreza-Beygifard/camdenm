# CAM and DENM

Basic Java classes to represent Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM, [ETSI EN 302 637-2](http://webapp.etsi.org/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=37126)) and Decentralized Environment Notification Message (DENM, [ETSI EN 302 637-3](http://webapp.etsi.org/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=37127)). CAM and DENM are built on top of Common Data Dictionary (CDD, [ETSI TS 102 894-2](http://webapp.etsi.org/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=43353)). Classes are annoted with [asn1-datatypes](https://github.com/alexvoronov/gcdc-asn1), so that [asn1-uper](https://github.com/alexvoronov/gcdc-asn1) can pack the objects.

### Status

CAM and DENM are complete (except for the getter methods). Usage examples for CAM and DENM are in [uppertester](https://github.com/alexvoronov/gn-uppertester).
